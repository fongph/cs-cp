<h3>Location tracking may be unavailable for more reasons:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The use of the mobile network to track location is forbidden by the settings</li>
    <li>Inaccuracy of location tracking (the area of uncertainty is too big to tell the exact location)</li>
    <li>Network Connection is not available (try to <a href="#">reboot the target device</a>)</li>
</ul>
