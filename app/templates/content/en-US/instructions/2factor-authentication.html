        <h5>What is two-factor authentication for the Apple ID?</h5>
        <p>
        Two-factor authentication is an extra layer of security for your Apple ID designed to ensure that you're the only person who can access your account, even if someone knows your password. With two-factor authentication, your account can only be accessed on devices you trust, like your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. When you want to sign in to the account on a new device for the first time, you'll need to provide two pieces of information - your password and the six-digit verification code that's automatically displayed on your trusted devices. By entering the code, you're verifying that you trust the new device. You can find more information here.
        </p>
        <p>
            Two-factor authentication is available to iCloud users with at least one device using iOS 9 or later. Users who don't have such devices, or canâ€™t update their devices, or are otherwise ineligible for two-factor authentication, may protect their Apple ID with two-step verification.
