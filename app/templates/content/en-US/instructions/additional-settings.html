<p>Since Pumpic does not have control over the target device with iOS (iCloud) Monitoring solution, we recommend you to adjust additional settings to get more Parental Control options. Here are a few quick tips:</p>


<h3>1. Improve Browser History Monitoring</h3>
<p>To disable private browsing and restrict adult websites:</p>
<p>Go to <b>Settings</b> > <b>General</b> > <b>Restrictions</b> and enter <b>Restriction Code</b> or create a new one. If a code has been already created and you do not know it, then the only way is to erase the device and set it as a new one.</p>

</p>
<p>Scroll down to Allowed Content and tap on Websites. Select Limit Adult Content. You can also allow and disallow certain websites bellow.</p>

<h3>2. Block Unwanted Applications</h3>

<p>Since it is not possible to monitor all apps with Pumpic, consider deleting all unwanted apps on the device and block possibility to install them without your approval:</p>
<p>Go to <b>Settings</b> > <b>General</b> > <b>Restrictions</b> and enter Restriction Code. Scroll down to <b>Installing Apps</b> and disable it. Now you can delete any app on the device. To install them back you need to re-enable Installing Apps feature, which is not possible without Restrictions Code.</p>

<h3>3. Block In-App Purchases</h3>
<p>To avoid unnecessary in-app purchases you can simply block this option:</p>
<p>Go to <b>Settings</b> > <b>General</b> > <b>Restrictions</b> and put in Restriction Code. Scroll down to in-app purchases and disable it. You can find a screenshot above.</p>
