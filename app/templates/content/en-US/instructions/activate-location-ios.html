<p>Location activation allows tracking the target device on the map. It will also let you follow route history and set Geofences in order to quickly find out if a user of the target device leaves or enters specified restricted areas.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The user of the target device can change Location settings. In case the above settings are deactivated, Pumpic will stop tracking the location of the target device. You will receive a notification immediately. However, we recommend you to lock Location settings: take the target device, open “Settings”, go to General > Restrictions, tap on “Enable Restrictions” and set a password. Then go to Restrictions > Location Services and choose "Don't Allow Changes".</p>
