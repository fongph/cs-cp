<h3>Location tracking may be unavailable for more reasons:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Using mobile network to define the location is forbidden in the settings</li>
    <li>The poor accuracy of location definition (is not being tracked by the application)</li>
    <li>The mobile network data is not available, rebooting the device may be of help</li>
</ul>
